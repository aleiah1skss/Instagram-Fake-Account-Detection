# Instagram-Fake-Account-Detection
This project classifies Instagram accounts as genuine or fake using machine learning. It uses Python to analyze profile data like profile pictures and follower counts. A Random Forest model was built and achieved high accuracy, providing a successful method to detect spammers.
# Instagram Fake Account Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Instagram accounts as either genuine or fake (spammers). The goal is to identify fraudulent accounts by analyzing various profile characteristics and activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was collected from Instagram and contains a variety of features related to user profiles. It is comprised of both genuine and fake accounts, which are used to train and test our classification model.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
    * `numpy` for numerical operations.
    * `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
    * `scikit-learn` for machine learning model building and evaluation.

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository-url]`.
2.  **Navigate to the Directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and change the directory to the cloned repository.
3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Run `jupyter notebook` to open the project in your browser.
4.  **Run the Notebook:** Open the `insta_fake_acc.ipynb` file and run all the cells.

## Key Findings & Results

The final model successfully classified Instagram accounts with high accuracy. The analysis highlighted that several key features are strong indicators of a fake account.

**Model Performance:**

* **Accuracy:** 0.9167

Instagram Fake Spammer Genuine Accounts
Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of identifying fake and spam accounts on Instagram. I developed a machine learning model to classify profiles as either genuine or fake based on key profile features and user activity.

Project By: Aliya Nishath

Company: Unified Mentor

Project Objective
The main objective was to build a robust and accurate classification model that can automatically detect spam accounts. The project follows a standard data science workflow, from data analysis to model evaluation.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Key Libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

seaborn & matplotlib: For data visualization.

scikit-learn: For building the machine learning model.

How to Run the Code
Clone the Repository: Use git clone [repository-url] to download the project files.

Launch Jupyter Notebook: Navigate to the project directory and run jupyter notebook from your terminal.

Run All Cells: Open the Jupyter Notebook file and execute all cells in the correct order to reproduce the analysis and results.

Key Findings & Results
The final Random Forest Classifier achieved a high accuracy in identifying fake accounts. The analysis revealed that key features like the number of followers and the presence of a profile picture are strong indicators of a fake account.
